### [incubator.py](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/RPi-Projects/blob/master/incubator.py)
The script reads and maintains internal temperature and humidity, recording the data in a MySQL database and ensuring the setting are ideal for incubating small quail eggs. This is a modification of AdaFruit's [script](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT/blob/master/examples/google_spreadsheet.py).
